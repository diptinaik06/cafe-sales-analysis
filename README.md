Café Sales Data Cleaning & Visualization ☕📊

This project is all about taking a messy café sales dataset and turning it into something clean, structured, and actually useful.  
I walked through the full process — cleaning, fixing errors, transforming columns, and creating clear visual insights that show how the café performs across items, payment methods, locations, and time.

# What This Project Covers
# Data Cleaning
- Fixed inconsistent and missing values across the dataset  
- Converted all numeric fields (Quantity, Price, Total Spent)  
- Handled “ERROR” and invalid entries  
- Cleaned and standardized categorical features like Payment Method, Item, Location  
- Converted dates into proper datetime format  
- Extracted Day, Month, Day Name, and Weekend/Weekday  
- Recalculated Total Spent where necessary  
- Removed duplicates and unnecessary columns  

Basically, the dataset went from messy to analysis-ready.

#  Data Visualization & Insights

I created visualizations to understand customer behavior and café performance, such as:

Top 5 Selling Items
Shows which menu items customers love the most.

Revenue Generated by Each Item
Identifies high-earning items like Salad, Smoothie, and Sandwich.

Payment Method Usage
Breakdown of how customers prefer to pay (Cash, Credit Card, Digital Wallet, etc.).

Sales by Location
Compares In-Store, Takeaway, and Unknown entries.

Weekday vs Weekend Sales
Reveals that weekdays have much higher activity than weekends.

Monthly Sales Trend
Shows that the café maintains steady monthly performance with mild fluctuations.

Item vs Payment Method Heatmap
A deeper look at which items are commonly purchased with which payment type.
